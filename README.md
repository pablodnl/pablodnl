Hello World 🌎!

I'm Pablo Lima, a dedicated family man 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 and passionate about learning 📚.

Since I've discovered about growth mindset 🌱, I saw my world gained another perspective and
I was so excited about what I could do in my life. My first choose was to learn English (and I'm doing!!).
And it have been amazing! Now I'm changing my work field based on an old love: Development 🖥️

If someone needs an enthusiastic learner to test or helping in something, please, let me know!
My focus is on Java and Full Stack Development (JS, Nodejs, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, etc)!

See you soon 👋
